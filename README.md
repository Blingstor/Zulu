Hi! 

I have an idea for creating a game and I was reffered here by a friend, I'm hoping to learn as much as I can even though I have no prior experience or knowledge of coding. I also want to learn coding to teach my four year old son, he seems to me into the tech stuff and would rather have him utilize the time constructively.

Blessed regards,
